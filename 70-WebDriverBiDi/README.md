### Webdriver BiDi

#### Purpose:
Preview of the upcoming "BiDirectional" features

#### Learning Objectives:
- What's coming up
- Where to track progress
- **Extra** credit: General introspection of SeleniumLibrary and how to use these new features before convenience keywords are implemented

#### Challenge:
* Enable BiDi support
* Describe something that you can do with BiDi that you couldn't before, or something that becomes much easier with BiDi
* **Extra** credit: Add a console message handler to the driver and save the messages to a list variable. Tip: `grep --recursive` or your IDE's "Go To Definition" or similar are your friends.

#### Resources:
- [Selenium's overview of BiDi](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidi/)
- Github issues for [script](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/13992) and [network](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/13993) webdriver commands
